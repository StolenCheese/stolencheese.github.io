I really enjoyed working on this, as I got to chill out in a room with friends for a weekend making a game that was mostly focused on art.

## Rhythm Mythril Fever

![Stage 1](/projects/camgamjam/demo1.png)

The premise of the game was to be a parody of Rhythm Heaven Fever, and to fit the theme "Beneath the earth" I chose of course to make it about dwarfs digging a hole set to hall of the mountain king.

The game was made in Godot 3, the first time I ever used the engine. The table I sat at had another group making a [godot game](https://sam0fc.itch.io/mushroom-mail), which I got to playtest ~~then have my feedback explicitly ignored, thanks~~.

I worked on a decent amount of the 3D models myself, but realized 10 hours in that the scope was far too large, so brought in a friend to make the models for vehicles, which did not disappoint:

I would love to upload the models to the website but I simply don't know how.
