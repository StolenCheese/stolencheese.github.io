## To Dice with Death

![Demo 1, Card dealing](/projects/dice-with-death/demo1.gif)

### Bugs

A very fun bug that was definitely my fault was the inability to roll a nat 20 on the d20.

I would swear it cheated me out of what really, really looked like a 20...

But other than that, a lot of fun.  A neat take on resource allotment.

The dice where programmed with a table of gameobjects of the text models relating to the number they represented, then found the one
pointing furthest upward when selecting a number. This worked great, as long as you remembered to fill in the table for every number. The d20
had no such entry for 20.

I could spend eternity just flicking the dice around, I loved how polished everything is! Wicked fun game and premise

best game I've played on this jam so far! It's creative, charming, and fun. It has a gameplay loop that makes it last longer than most games on this jam. I'd definitely love to see this turned into a full-fledged game with a story!

Cool concept, very funny and witty writing. I liked the inclusion of different types of dice, that allows for this push-your-luck moments, when you decide to put just one d20 on the card and hope for the best.

I like the background as well, dying and dealing with Death chores is fun and creative idea. Nice job!
