A couple images showing the process of making this sci-fi retro travel poster:

From a different angle, we can get a better understanding of the layout of the spaceport:

I'm very happy with the cel shading effect to create the impression of a rocket launch lighting sand, and the shader turned out very simple;
a distorted gradient noise into a bump node to create the interesting lighting patterns on the ground, then a shader to rgb node into a colour ramp to cell shade.
