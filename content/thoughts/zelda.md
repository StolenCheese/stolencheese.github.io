## Breath of the Wild

They know this one was gunna be successful and planned for it.

- Bombs finally unlimited.
- My most played zelda game, with about 150 hours.
- No real bad guy - plot is very tied to just environmental story telling in the most open world since Wind Waker.
- Some incredible tech used in the rendering for the switch, although most zelda games pushed the limits.
- Progression and dungeoneering were issues - most everything is unlocked right at the start of the game, and not spread out as in other zelda games.
    - results in no reason to re-explore areas with new stuff, but it could be argued that this wouldn't be desirable in a game already this chock filled with content, and unsolvable shrines would have likely been quite annoying.
- Riding a horse after the loftwings is definitely a grounding experience, although it looks like tears of the kingdom may bring back a few more skyward sword like elements.
- Populated towns, but very little depth to them - most NPCs still just repeat the same couple lines, expect for the couple that expand out into the most fulfilling quests (Looking at you, tarry town). Could have done with some inspiration from the Witcher games here.
- A seamless day/night cycle that progresses over time but still allows the skyward sword 'change to day/night by resting'.
- A proper open world map, complete with ubisoft towers.

## Skyward Sword

A very experimental zelda game, that felt the need to re-invent a load of stuff it didn't need to, but also added a lot of fresh ideas.

- Maps still not perfected - the art for the global view is neat, but zooming around is slow, and it feels much more in the UI then in the world - areas are split by loading sections and not geographical features, for example.
- Day night cycle only works on main island, but becomes a welcome addition to the series
- The motion controls I thought were OK, but the HD version just ends up far more playable in a much more relaxed way.
- A huge amount of mechanics, each introduced slowly in new areas
    - But as with most previous games, some of these end up forgotten or redundant (grappling hook in wind waker, slingshot here)

### Faron Woods

- The start of the game is very slow after leaving the island - walking around finding korok replacements are tediously slow.
- Award for most flirting in a Zelda game.

### Eldin Volcano

- They got rid of the gorons and replaced them with moles?
- Lizard dudes are new to the series here, and appear again in BOTW, and are a fun addition.
- Bombs have a limited carry space while being effectively unlimited. This would be fine if some puzzle required special management of bombs, but they dont, and instead it exists as an arbitrary limitation
    - the same problem exists with wallet size - it doesn't really add anything to the game to limit this.

### Lanayru Desert +  Time Travel

I love games featuring this kind of switch-between-current-and-past travel, my other highlight being Titanfall 2's Effect and Cause.

Most dungeons in this game suffer from Zelda's classic 'increase the entropy of the level' style solving - If you make a change, and the game doesn't let you undo it, this part of the puzzle is 'solved'. The time crystals are a great change from this, because only one can be activated at once. When there is only one in an area, of course this issue remains, but for the most part they are used in groups to create quite interesting puzzles.

This isn't the worst thing in the world in a large checkpoint kinda vibe, but in this game hitting any switch has a chance to play the classic tune and be a successful piece of progress in the puzzle, no matter how small the increment, which can make the bigger puzzles much more linear then they had the potential to be.

Coming back to this game after 10 odd years, the desert is the biggest change from my memories - this was the first open world game I ever played, so the original desert was a huge shock for me at the time, and I remember feeling it being a vast explorable space, but comparing it to BOTW now it feels tiny compared to the desert in that game.

What terrible apocalypse events caused the bokogoblins to stop using tasers?

## Twilight Princess

- I don't remember a lot from this game, need to replay it.

## Wind Waker

- Some proper good dungeons.
- Reoccurring NPCs that are fun (pirates).
- Very annoying minigames

## Ocarina of Time

- Laid out a lot of zelda mechanics that were seen many more times.
