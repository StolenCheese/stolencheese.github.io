But other than that, a lot of fun. A neat take on resource allotment. <br> -- Tahnan</blockquote><p>The dice where programmed with a table of gameobjects of the text models relating to the number they represented, then found the one pointing furthest upward when selecting a number. This worked great, as long as you remembered to fill in the table for every number. The d20 had no such entry for 20.<h3 id=reviews>Reviews</h3><blockquote>I could spend eternity just flicking the dice around, I loved how polished everything is! Wicked fun game and premise <br> -- Pefeper, <i>Jimmy Blitz and the Rocket Dice</i></blockquote><blockquote>best game I've played on this jam so far! It's creative, charming, and fun. It has a gameplay loop that makes it last longer than most games on this jam. I'd definitely love to see this turned into a full-fledged game with a story! <br> -- iciclepops, <i>A Gamble with Death</i></blockquote><blockquote>Cool concept, very funny and witty writing. I liked the inclusion of different types of dice, that allows for this push-your-luck moments, when you decide to put just one d20 on the card and hope for the best. I like the background as well, dying and dealing with Death chores is fun and creative idea. Nice job! <br> -- MonsieurPazur, <i>Character Sheets, Please</i></blockquote><p><img alt="Demo 2, Dice rolling" src=/projects/dice-with-death/demo2.gif> <img alt="Demo 3, Dice return" src=/projects/dice-with-death/demo3.gif><h3 id=post-jam>Post Jam</h3><p>After the jam was up and voting had finished, we did a little polishing work, adding some post process effects, fixing the above bugs, and adding more dice varieties.<p><img alt=Update src=/projects/dice-with-death/update.png></article></div><footer class=footer><h2><a href=https://github.com/pettett>Github</a> | <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxwell-pettett/>LinkedIn</a> | maxwell pettett at gmail dot com | <a href=https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@pettett rel=me>Mastodon</a></h2></footer>
